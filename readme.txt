To run, simply double click on the SpellingAid.jar file.

Please place the following in the same directory as the SpellingAid.jar file
- NZCER-spelling-lists.txt
- big_buck_bunny_1_minute.avi
- reversed.avi

The NZ voice from Festival has been assumed to have been installed following
the instructions on Canvas.

Please note: reversed.avi has been generated using FFMPEG beforehand. Usually, if
the file has been deleted, we use SwingWorker and FFMPEG to generate in the
background, however, the reverse filter does not seem to present in lab computers
so we have supplied the reversed.avi file pre-generated.
